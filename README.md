# MarsAnalytica
This is a public hosting of MarsAnalytica, my hardest challenge created for the [2018 Northsec CTF](https://nsec.io/competition/)

It went unsolved at the CTF, so it is being hosted here for the world to try. It is packed with [UPX](https://github.com/upx/upx/) simply to
descrease the file size. To start the challenge, I recommend unpacking it with `upx -d MarsAnalytica`.

The challenge is also on the [Ringzer0 Team CTF](https://ringzer0team.com/) website and the flag can be tested there.
